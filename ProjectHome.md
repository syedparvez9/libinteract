Libinteract is a set of tools for use with [AVR](http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/) microcontroller. It is especially intended for **new media art** projects involving playing with sensors, lights, sounds and actuators.

The library focuses on building reusable and modular components, most of which can be used with any Atmel AVR products. Part of the library is based on the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) library and will thus only work with supported architectures (ATMega8/168), however this is what is needed in most cases.
